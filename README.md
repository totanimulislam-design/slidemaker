## Board gestures

Every item on the slide board — shapes that come from the Deck, deck-generated
elements, groups, resize/rotate handles and the rubber-band marquee — is driven
by one pointer state machine, `src/lib/dragSession.ts`. Its guarantees:

- **A move event alone never moves anything.** A gesture exists only after a
  left `pointerdown` on the target; hover / enter / leave / selecting never
  write geometry.
- **A click is a click.** Dragging starts only after the pointer travels past
  `DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX` (4px); press-and-release inside that band only selects.
- **Position is written only while `isDragging === true`** (state also carries
  `isPointerDown`, `dragStartX/Y`, `initialObjectX/Y`).
- **A release always ends the gesture** — `pointerup`, `pointercancel`,
  `pointerleave`, lost pointer capture, window blur and a hidden tab all reset
  the state, so a missed release can never leave an item following the cursor.

`npm run test:drag` covers the sequences above, plus regression cases proving the
old pattern (gesture armed on press + `onPointerMove` on the item) did leak.
